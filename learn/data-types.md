      <p>
        You'll frequently handle data when you build a DMN model, and when you think about data, you need to think about
        types.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes you will face very simple situations, like this:

        On this example, the decision node probably as a decision logic (e.g., a decision table) that checks the input
        nodes <b>Age</b> and <b>Driver license type</b>. In this example the <i>values</i> for these input nodes are,
        respectively, the number <code>28</code> and the string <code>"Class"</code>, since this person looks old enough
        and has the properly license, the decision node returns the boolean <code>true</code>.

          The <a href="https://www.omg.org/spec/DMN/About-DMN/">DMN Specification</a> often refers to data types as Item Definitions, both names means strictly the same
          thing.
